* Purpose
This is an example of how a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) can be used to
enhance the security of a server-side password manager. A RNG is used instead of
an actual PUF in this project.

This project was done as part of my INF639: Nanomaterials and Nanoelectronics
for Cybersecurity at NAU.
* Communication Flows
(client --> server) <uid> <password>: enroll
(server --> client) enrollment success

(client --> server) <uid> <password>: get balance
(server --> client) current balance: <balance>

(client --> server) <uid> <password>: add <dollars>
(server --> client) new balance: <balance>

(client --> server) <uid> <password>: withdraw <dollars>
(server --> client) new balance: <balance>
